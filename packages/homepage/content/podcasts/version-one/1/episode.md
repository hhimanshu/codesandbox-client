Listen to the new podcast, Version One, from CodeSandbox on some of the web’s
most talked about tools and the makers behind them. In this episode, host
Maurice Cherry invites Matt Biilmann to share about his experience with
programming and creating programming businesses. He is the co-founder and CEO of
Netlify, a modern platform for high-performance apps. It is currently used by
well known businesses such as Figma, Shopify, Mailchimp, and Nike.

The episode begins with Matt sharing about his life and career before becoming
involved in programming. Matt was a student at the University of Copenhagen in
Denmark majoring in music psychology and cultural studies. After college, he
began working as a music journalist with programming simply being a side hobby
for fun. He shares how he was always fascinated with programming and discovering
how it worked. This fascination and hobby began to grow when he moved to Spain
in 2004. During his time in Spain, programming became more than a hobby and he
was hired as a programming engineer. He eventually became a senior Rails
developer at the Spanish company Domestika, which built websites for small
businesses all over Europe. During his time at Domestika, Matt lead the
engineering teams for the creation of websites.

After his time working at Domestika, Matt decided to create his own business
called Webpop. The goal of this businesses was to build cloud hosted CMS
services to help increase efficiency in the building of websites. Webpop was a
big hit and, while Matt was happy with this business, he felt that it would
eventually move away from the one platform origin and application. He shares how
he began to have new ideas and visions, and began embracing the new kinds of
developing and programming. The results of these visions and desire to expand
resulted in the creation of BitBalloon, a series software development platform.
This quickly gained a lot of interest, however, Matt decided to expand on this
new platform even more.

Next, the conversation moves to Matt sharing about the creation of Netlify from
BitBalloon. It all began with Matt reaching out to his friend, and now current
President at Netlify, Christian Bach. At the time, Chris had also been busy in
the world of programming and had created Capsize Productions. Together with
their experience in building businesses and in programming, Chris and Matt
created a vision with the goal of offering faster, cheaper, and more secure
options. The blueprints for Netlify were created when they began talking and
brainstorming for ways to create a product that provided a single solution. In
2015, the vision became a reality when BitBalloon was revised into the new
company now known as Netlify.

How did Matt and Chris convince people to use Netlify? This is the question that
Matt addresses next as he talks about the importance of having the right
“circles”, a core group of early adopters who try new things. These early
adopters were able to investigate this new business and then share their
experience and feedback with others, allowing for growth in marketing.
Additionally, Matt shares how early on they put a big emphasis on content
marketing. They did this by publishing two blog posts every week along with open
source adoption where they gave away as much as they could for free. These were
big voices for the new business and helped it grow to what it is today.

While the company was growing, Matt points out some setbacks they did face. He
shares how the biggest setback was simply the fact that in the beginning there
were only two people running a big business. This resulted in lots of long, hard
work and endless nights of coding. However, this setback didn’t stop them, and
in 2015 Netlify really began to take off when they helped Vitaly Friedman and
his business, Smashing Magazine. After this, they were able to raise their first
round of funding and grow their team of engineers. He concludes the podcast by
sharing how the best part of creating Netlify has been getting to use his
passion with his best friend to pour themselves into such a rewarding outcome.
