Coders and creators of all kinds use CodeSandbox to prototype and share their ideas. This creator profile showcases the sandboxes of creative technologist [Charlie Gerard](https://codesandbox.io/u/charliegerard) and we chat to her about how she harnesses her curiosity to inspire and drive her creative experiments.

Charlie is a Senior front-end developer at Netlify, a Google developer expert in web technologies, and a Mozilla Tech Speaker. She's the author of '[Practical Machine Learning in JavaScript](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484264171),' a guide to TensorFlow.js for web developers. She spends her free time exploring the fields of human-computer interaction and creative coding on the web.

Check out [her profile](https://codesandbox.io/u/charliegerard) on CodeSandbox for a range of fun experiments from [training a machine learning model](https://codesandbox.io/s/ktncm) to [playing Street Fighter with your body movements](https://codesandbox.io/s/sf-ml-t08zd).

## How would you describe your work?
My work is always very experimental. I'm not really interested in making things with a practical goal in mind. What motivates me is the research and the creativity. How far can I push the technologies I am using? Can I use them in an unusual way? What happens if I mix different technologies together? That kind of thing.

## How did you get into it?
I got into it soon after I started learning to code. I had previously bought a Sphero robotic ball and a Leap Motion device just because I liked gadgets. Still, when I realized I could program them using JavaScript, I decided to see if I could control the robotic ball using my hands' movements over the Leap Motion, and it worked!

From there, I swapped the Leap Motion for a Myo armband that uses muscle data to make the ball move when I execute certain gestures, and I also swapped the robotic ball for a drone... I kept experimenting with different devices and different technologies to see what was possible.

## Who are the people or projects that inspired you while you were learning?
The project that I found the most inspiring was the [Johnny-Five JavaScript library](http://johnny-five.io/), created by Rick Waldron. I don't think I would have created as many things as I did without this library. The fact that it allows JavaScript developers to build projects using microcontrollers and sensors is just amazing.

## What are you excited to learn next?
Currently, I'm trying to learn about Digital Signal Processing to unlock some projects I want to build. I'm really excited about some ideas, but I don't have the right knowledge yet to build them.

## A tip for beginners
Personally, I would always advise you to start small and try to recreate a project you found interesting. Once you've managed to reproduce it yourself, you can go from there and make some custom modifications, for example, add a new sensor. Also, start with a project with at least one aspect to it that you're familiar with. So if you're a web developer and want to learn about virtual reality, maybe start with WebVR using Three.js instead of Unity or ARkit/ARCore. The more complex the project, the longer it will take you to build it, and the more likely you will be to give up.

## A project to fork
One of my favorite projects is the one I called [HVBRD](http://bit.ly/hvbrd), which uses a device's accelerometer and gyroscope with WebSockets to let users interact with a 3D environment as if they were using a hoverboard.

Fork it and play around with changing the 3D landscape design or adding different 3D objects to the scene.
