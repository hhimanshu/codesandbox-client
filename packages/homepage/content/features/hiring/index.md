SEOText:
  Whiteboard exercises don’t get to the core skills you're looking for in a
  candidate. With CodeSandbox, you can run remote technical interviews and set
  coding challenges that let you see how candidates assess problems, approach
  solutions, and work with code.

### More efficient interviews for interviewers

Set a task to solve and review shared projects with your team to get feedback on
candidates' solutions. Or pair up with remote candidates, and work through
coding challenges together in real-time. So you can get a feel for their
problem-solving and communication skills.

With CodeSandbox, you get an instant IDE that you can use on any device with a
web browser. With live preview and auto-deploy, everyone can see real results.

There’s nothing to install, and no local setup—interviewers and interviewees can
get straight to the task at hand.

### Better interview experiences for candidates

VS Code powers the editor in CodeSandbox, so candidates get a real coding
environment that looks and feels familiar. Candidates can focus on the code they
are writing, rather than getting to grips with a new tool.

By creating a template project from which all candidates work from, you’re
leveling the playing field. You can use front-end or back-end code, add npm
dependencies, and configure it however you like. So you know tests are fair, and
experiences are standardized.
