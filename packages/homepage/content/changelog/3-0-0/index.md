description: Redesigned editor and VS Code extensions support
---

###

#### Features

1. VS Code is now the core editor in CodeSandbox, enabling keybindings, user
   snippets, commands, editor grid view and more
2. We now support some VS Code extensions, including native TypeScript type
   checking, automatic import of variables, refactoring support, and VIM mode
3. Added a devtool view with tabs for tests and console
4. A new design, including menu and status bar and UI changes
5. Added GraphQL, styled-components and yarn.lock syntax
   highlighting/autocompletions

#### Fixes

- VS Code elements like the configuration UI and the image viewer now work
- We no longer hide the activity bar when viewing a sandbox you don't own
