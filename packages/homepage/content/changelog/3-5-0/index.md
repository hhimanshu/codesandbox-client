### A Snappier, New Look Editor

When chatting with folks in the CodeSandbox community, thereâ€™s one word that
comes up more than any other: Speed! So we've evolved the design of the editor
and undertaken a range of performance optimization tasks so that the editor now
loads more quickly, and feels more responsive.

#### Features

1. Added progressive loading of each part of the editor instead of waiting for
   everything to be ready upfront
2. Re-designed the activity bar and all component parts
3. Updated the navigation bar design
4. Added a new default theme: CodeSandbox Black

#### Fixes

- Performance improvements
