#### Features
1. Our new-look profile pages let you tell folks about yourself and your creations. Add a description, social links, set a header, and pin your fave sandboxes.
2. We added the ability to [specify the Node version](/docs/configuration) in any container and also in CI.

#### Fixes
- Folders are now included in searches on the dashboard
- Added `allow-downloads` in sandboxes to allow users to demonstrate libraries that include downloads
- You now get a better error message when importing a private repo and you're not signed in
- We added support for shader languages in the editor
