  A workspace makes it easier to collaborate on code with others. In a workspace
  you share ownership of sandboxes and templates, and can keep organized with
  folders, enabling your entire team to work on sandboxes together.

## Creating a Workspace

You can create and manage workspaces from the dashboard.

As soon as you've created a workspace, you will be shown the team overview.

## Inviting People to a Workspace

There's no limit on how many members a workspace can have. You can invite others
by entering their username or email address and selecting 'Add Member.' They
will get a notification (the bell icon in the header) in CodeSandbox and email
when invited to a new workspace. From there, they can accept or decline the
invitation.

## Sharing Sandboxes

You can choose which workspace you're in from the workspace drop-down at the
top-left on the dashboard. You can create new sandboxes directly from here or
from a different workspace, select one or more sandboxes, right-click and select
'Move to Folder', where you can choose the workspace and folder you want to move
them into. All sandboxes in a workspace can be seen or edited by other team
members, depending on their permission levels. We keep track of who created the
sandbox, though, and only the the original creator of the sandbox can delete it.

## Collaborating on Sandboxes

You and other members can open a sandbox at the same time and see each other's
cursor to work together. You can still invite other people who aren't members of
the team to the sandbox or [live session](/docs/live).
